MSBuild uses project files to build projects. 

Use the .proj extension when you create a project file that builds projects.
Use the .targets extension when you create a reusable project file to import into other project files. Files with a .targets extension typically don't build anything themselves, they simply contain instructions that you can import into your .proj files.
